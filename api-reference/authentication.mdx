Codemail uses `Tokens` to identify developers. Access to this token can grant a user access to create forms on your behalf.

> We recommend that you store your token in an environment variable at all times.

```js
subscribe('Your_Token')
```

## API Tokens

A token is granted to your account upon creation and can be recieved by going to your dashboard and clicking `Copy Mail Token`.

This token grants your a pass to use the Zymono Codemail services. If your token is revoked, so is your pass to use the services.

<Info>Your token may be used to track your use of the services</Info>

## Spam Prevention

Codemail has measures in place to prevent spam of our email system.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Emails Per IP">
    We prevent two users from the same IP address signing up in a row. (Another user has to signup to any Cdemail form on another IP to allow them to signup again)
    
    If for some reason this is a problem contact support at: inovate@code.mail.zymono.com
  </Accordion>


  <Accordion title="Email Verification">
    We send a verification message to every email that signs up on Codemail, if a user did not signup they can remove their account from your mailing list.
    
    Unfortunately, at this time you cannot customize the verification message.
