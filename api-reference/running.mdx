Codemail uses `html` and `js` as our main languages for API usage.

> You are not required to use these languages, these are just what we reccommend and support.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <body>
   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  /body>
</html>
```

## Running Locally

- Create a .html file
- Place your Codemail code there
- Right click and open the file in a browser

### Running Publicly

- Complete Local Steps
- Upload the .html file to your hosting provider
